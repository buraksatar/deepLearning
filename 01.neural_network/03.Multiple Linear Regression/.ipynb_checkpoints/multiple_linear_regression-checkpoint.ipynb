    "We just saw how we can predict life expectancy using BMI. Here, BMI was the predictor, also known as an independent variable. A predictor is a variable we're looking at in order to make predictions about other variables, while the values we are trying to predict are known as dependent variables. In this case, life expectancy was the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the outcome we want to predict depends on more than one variable, we can make a more complicated model. As long as they're relevant to the situation, using more independent/predictor variables can help we get a better prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there's just one predictor, the linear regression model is a line, but as we add more predictor variables, we're adding more dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have one predictor variable, the equation of the line is\n",

    "***y=mx+b***\n",
